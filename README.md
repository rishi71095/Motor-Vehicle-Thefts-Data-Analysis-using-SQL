# Motor-Vehicle-Thefts-Data-Analysis-using-SQL
Data exploration project analyzing stolen vehicle trends by time, type, and location. Covers yearly, monthly, and daily theft patterns, vehicle type &amp; characteristics, and regional theft analysis with population and density insights.

*I recorded my full project walkthrough and uploaded it on YouTube which is great if you want to follow along with my thought process and hopefully make some suggestions.* Watch it [here](https://youtu.be/oedT6Fkibpk).

# Project Description:

The goal of the project was to analyze a dataset of stolen vehicles and answer specific business questions related to when, what, and where vehicles are most likely to be stolen.

## ðŸ”¹ Objective 1 â€“ Identify when vehicles are likely to be stolen

* Analyze theft counts by year, month, and day of week
* Replace numeric weekdays with full names
* Explore patterns and trends in theft frequency

## ðŸ”¹ Objective 2 â€“ Identify which vehicles are likely to be stolen

* Determine most and least stolen vehicle types
* Calculate average vehicle age by type
* Compare luxury vs standard theft percentages
* Build a vehicle type vs color table for top categories

## ðŸ”¹ Objective 3 â€“ Identify where vehicles are likely to be stolen

* Count thefts per region
* Combine theft data with population and density statistics
* Compare vehicle types between the most and least dense regions

## How to Run

1. **Set up the database**  
   Run the provided SQL script:  
   `create_stolen_vehicles_db.sql`  
   
   This script will create the database, define the tables (`stolen_vehicles` and `regions`), and populate them with the necessary data (via `INSERT` statements included in the script).

2. **Run the analysis queries**  
   - Open your preferred SQL editor (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver).  
   - Connect to the database where you ran the script.  
   - Execute the analysis queries provided in the repository to reproduce the results.

3. **Review results**  
   Inspect the query outputs to answer the project objectives on vehicle theft trends.
